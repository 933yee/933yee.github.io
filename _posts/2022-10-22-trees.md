**Left Child-Right Sibling**
===
- ## Property
    - Each node has exactly two link fields
        - Left link(child): points to **leftmost child node**.
        - Right link(sibling): points to **closest sibling node**.
    
    - Rotate clockwise 45°

**Special Binary Tree**
===

- ## Full binary tree
    - A binary tree of depth <span style="color:red">k</span> which has <span style="color:red">2k – 1</span> nodes<br>
![full tree](/assets/images/full_tree.png){: width="300" , height = "300"}

- ## Complete binary tree 
    - All the levels of the tree are filled completely except the lowest level nodes which are filled from <span style="color:red">as left as possible</span>.<br>

**Traversal and Iterator**
===
- ## Property
    - Each operator appears before its operands.
    - No need <span style="color:red"> parentheses </span>.
    - Priority of operators is no longer relevant.
    - Easier to parse for a machine.
- ## Evaluation
    - Step
        The same as evaluating postfix, but read from <span style="color:red"> **right to left** </span>
    - Example
        - / A * B C 
            1. push C
            2. push B
            3. *(detecting an operator)* pop two operands out and push the result after calculating them
            4. push A
            5. *(detecting an operator)* pop two operands out and push the result after calculating them
            
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The result is <span style="color:red"> A / (B * C) </span>.
